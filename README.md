# Snake Game
<br>
Demo -> https://github.com/Ishika411/Simple-Snake-Game

This is a simple snake game project, a classic beginner-level programming exercise that involves creating a game where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding obstacles and its own body. The snake's movements are controlled by w(UP), a(RIGHT), s(DOWN), d(LEFT) and x(STOP). The length of snakes body increases by 1, everytime it eats the food. Hope yoy all like this.
